## Project Report: E-commerce Website Development

### Introduction
I have developed a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce website encompassing front-end, back-end, and middleware components. This project demonstrates my proficiency in web development using a variety of technologies and tools.

### Technologies Used
1. **Backend**: Java Spring Boot
2. **Middleware**: Java
3. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
4. **Database**: SQL

### Project Description
The e-commerce website I developed is designed to offer a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to browse, add, and purchase products. Here is a detailed breakdown of the various components and functionalities:

### Backend
The backend of the application is built using **Java Spring Boot**, which provides a robust framework for building web applications. It includes the following features:
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. User details are securely stored and managed in a SQL database.
- **Product Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete products. Product details are stored in the SQL database.

### Middleware
The middleware, developed using **Java**, handles the communication between the front-end and back-end. It ensures data is correctly passed, processed, and stored. It also includes:
- **Business Logic**: This layer processes user inputs and queries, ensuring they are correctly interpreted and handled by the back-end.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that all data submitted to the server meets the required formats and standards before it is processed and stored.

### Frontend
The frontend of the application is crafted using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a user-friendly interface. Key features include:
- **User Interface (UI)**: Designed to be intuitive and responsive, allowing users to easily navigate the website and perform actions such as browsing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript is used to create interactive and dynamic elements, enhancing the user experience.

### Database
The database is managed using **SQL**, which stores all critical information such as user details and product data. Key functionalities include:
- **User Data Storage**: Stores user credentials, ensuring secure login and registration processes.
- **Product Data Storage**: Stores product details, including names, descriptions, prices, and stock levels.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login functionality.
- **Product Management**: Ability to add, update, and delete products.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with an SQL database for storing user and product data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A responsive and intuitive front-end design.
- **Product Addition**: Admins can add products using the URL `localhost:8080/add_product`.

### Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to integrate various technologies to develop a fully functional e-commerce website. It highlights my skills in Java Spring Boot, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, and demonstrates my understanding of full-stack web development principles.
